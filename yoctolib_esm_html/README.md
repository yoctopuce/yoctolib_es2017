Yoctopuce EcmaScript 2017 library
=================================

## What is this library good for ?

This library provides access to [Yoctopuce devices](https://www.yoctopuce.com) for Node.js v7.6 and later.
It handles asynchronous communication with the devices using Promise objects, 
leveraging the new EcmaScript 2017 `async` / `await` non-blocking syntax for asynchronous I/O.

This npm module [yoctolib-es2017](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoctolib-es2017) uses the traditional
CommonJS module format for node.js. If you want a module packages using the new
ECMAScript module standard, to facilitates static resolution of dependencies and
type checking, use the npm package 
[yoctolib-esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yoctolib-esm) instead.

You will find examples in the zipped library on [Yoctopuce web site](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/libraries.php)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/yoctopuce/yoctolib_es2017).
